"# ECE 551" 
This repository explores my experiments done on the subject of sound based machine learning for UNM's ECE 551 - Projects course

The project is broken up into modules that walk through the full process, with appropriate comments for each. The dataset is included, and explained within Module 1.

In addition, 3 PyTorch weights files are provided that contain trained weights for the Cepstrum Coefficients CNN in Module 6 for two dataset types, along with the ResNet MFCC weights for Module 7. These are provided as examples of well trained networks, as the training can be somewhat unpredictable.
